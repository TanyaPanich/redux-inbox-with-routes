Stories
There are a lot of stories here, which is intentional. The idea is for you to become fluent with these basic concepts before moving on to the more complex aspects of React.


1. Message Display --> done

    Users should see a list of messages with the correct styles

    When a user views the app
    Then they should see a list of messages with their subjects
    If the message is read, it should have the read style
    If the message is unread, it should have the unread
    If the message is selected, it should have the selected style and the box should be checked
    If there are labels on a message, they should appear
    If the message is starred, then the star should be filled in, otherwise it should be empty

2. Starring --> done

    Users should be able to star and unstar a message.

    When a user clicks the star next to a message
    Then it should toggle whether the message is starred or not
    For example if it was starred, and you clicked on it, it should be unstarred

3. Selecting Individual Messages --> done

    Users should be able to select and deselect individual messages.

    When a user checks the checkbox on a message
    Then the message should be highlighted

    When a user unchecks the checkbox on a message
    Then the message should _not_ be highlighted

    4. Bulk Select / Deselect
    Users should be able to select and deselect messages.

    Given that no messages are selected
    When a user checks the "Select All" checkbox
    Then it should check all messages (and highlight them)

    Given that some messages are selected
    When a user checks the "Select All" checkbox
    Then it should check all messages (and highlight them)

    Given that all messages are selected
    When a user unchecks the "Select All" checkbox
    Then it should uncheck all messages (and unhighlight them)

4. Marking Messages as Read --> done

    Users should be able to mark messages as read.

    When a user selects messages
    And presses "Mark As Read"
    Then each selected message should be marked as read
    And should no longer be bold

5. Marking Messages as Unread --> done

    Users should be able to mark messages as unread.

    When a user selects messages
    And presses "Mark As Unread"
    Then each selected message should be marked as unread
    And should should appear bold

6. Deleting Messages --> done

    Users should be able to delete selected messages

    When a user selects messages
    And presses "Delete" (the Trash icon)
    Then each selected message should be removed from the list
    And the unread count should update
    And "Select All" button should update

7. Adding Labels --> done

    When a user selects messages from the sidebar
    And chooses a label from the "Add Label" dropdown
    Then that label should be added to all selected messages
    But if the message already contains the label then it should not be added twice
    NOTE: It's OK to hard-code the list of labels

8. Removing Labels --> done

    When a user selects messages from the sidebar
    And chooses a label from the "Remove Label" dropdown
    Then that label should be removed from all of the selected messages that contain the label
    NOTE: It's OK to hard-code the list of labels

    NOTE: If you try to remove a label from a message that doesn't have that label, there should be no errors

9. Unread Message Count --> done

    Users should always see the number of unread messages

    When a user changes which messages are read / unread
    Then the unread count in the upper right-hand corner should update
    And when there are 0 unread messages it should display "0 unread messages"
    And when there is 1 unread message it should display "1 unread message"
    And when there's more than 1 unread message it should display "_n_ unread messages"

10. Select All Button State --> done

    Users should see the state of the select all button change as messages are selected

    When no messages are checked
    Then the "Select All" button should be in the "unchecked" state

    When some messages are checked
    Then the "Select All" button should be in the "half-checked" state

    When all messages are checked
    Then the "Select All" button should be in the "checked" state
    NOTE: the "Select All" button must stay in sync at all times.

11. Select All Button State --> done

    Users should not be able to click on toolbar items when no messages are selected
